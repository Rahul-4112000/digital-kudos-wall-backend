# ðŸ§ª Standard Operating Procedure: Component Tests

**Status:** Mandatory  
**Version:** 1.0

**NON-NEGOTIABLE STANDARD:** Adherence to this SOP is mandatory for all Component Tests. Deviations are not permitted without explicit architectural review and approval.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This SOP defines the standards for writing Component Tests for the Digital Kudos Wall backend application. The goal is to verify that a component, typically encompassing a full use case from the web layer down to the application layer, is correctly wired and behaves as expected, while remaining isolated from other components and external infrastructure.

---

## Scope

This SOP applies to tests that exercise a slice of the application's functionality through its entry point (e.g., an HTTP request) but use test doubles for all out-of-process dependencies (like databases, external APIs, and message queues).

These tests align with the "Component Tests" category in the Modern Test Pyramid, sitting between Sociable Unit Tests and broader, end-to-end System Tests.

## Definitions

- **Component Test:** An automated test that verifies the behavior of a component through its public-facing interface, with its dependencies replaced by test doubles.
- **Component (in this context):** A group of related classes that collaborate to fulfill a specific piece of business functionality. For our backend, this is typically an Express route, its corresponding controller, and the application use case it invokes.
- **Boundary:** The line between the component under test and its out-of-process dependencies. In our case, the `UserRepository` and `EmailService` interfaces represent the boundaries.

## Key Principles (Non-Negotiable)

## Isolate the Component

- **Standard:** The component under test MUST be isolated from its real, out-of-process dependencies. All dependencies at the boundary (e.g., repository and external service interfaces) MUST be replaced with test doubles (stubs/spies).
- **Rationale:** This ensures the test is fast, reliable, and focuses solely on the logic of the component itself, not the behavior of external systems. Failures in a component test point directly to a bug within that component.

### Test Through the Public Interface

- **Standard:** Tests MUST interact with the component through its public interface, which for our backend is the HTTP API. Tests will use a library like `supertest` to make real HTTP requests to a test instance of the application.
- **Rationale:** This ensures we are testing the component as its clients (e.g., the frontend) would use it, including HTTP routing, request/response serialization, status codes, and headers.

### Use Dependency Injection

- **Standard:** The application MUST be architected to allow dependencies to be injected. The main application entry point (`createApp`) must accept its core dependencies (like use cases) as arguments.
- **Rationale:** Dependency Injection is the key mechanism that enables component testing. It allows us to supply the _real_ dependencies in production and _test doubles_ in a test environment.

## Test Structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)

- **Standard:** All tests MUST follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.

  ```typescript
  // Example for the RegisterUser endpoint
  describe("POST /users/register", () => {
    it("should return 201 when user is successfully registered", async () => {
      // Arrange
      // 1. Create mock dependencies
      const mockUserRepository: UserRepository = {
        /* jest.fn() mocks */
      };
      const mockEmailService: EmailService = {
        /* jest.fn() mocks */
      };

      // 2. Create the real use case with mock dependencies
      const registerUserUseCase = new RegisterUserUseCase(mockUserRepository, mockEmailService);

      // 3. Create the app with the test-configured use case
      const app = createApp({ registerUserUseCase });

      // 4. Define request body and stub mock responses
      const requestBody = { email: "test@example.com", password: "ValidPassword123!" };
      (mockUserRepository.findByEmail as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(null);
      (mockUserRepository.save as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(undefined);

      // Act
      // 5. Make a real HTTP request to the test app instance
      const response = await request(app).post("/users/register").send(requestBody).expect(201);

      // Assert
      // 6. Verify the HTTP response and any interactions with mocks
      expect(response.body.email).toBe(requestBody.email);
      expect(mockUserRepository.save).toHaveBeenCalled();
      expect(mockEmailService.sendConfirmationEmail).toHaveBeenCalledWith(requestBody.email);
    });
  });
  ```

### Test Setup and Teardown

- **Standard:** For a test suite (`describe` block) that targets a single component, common setup logic, especially the instantiation of mocks, SHOULD be placed in a `beforeEach` hook.
- **Rationale:** This reduces code duplication across tests, making the suite cleaner and easier to maintain. It also ensures a clean set of mocks for every single test case, preventing test-to-test contamination.

### Assertion Granularity in Component Tests

- **Standard:** Assertions in component tests SHOULD focus on the public contract: HTTP status codes, response body structure, and essential headers. They SHOULD also verify that the component correctly interacts with its dependencies (e.g., asserting that a repository's `save` method was called). They SHOULD NOT re-test fine-grained business logic that is covered by unit tests.
- **Rationale:** The goal is to test the integration and wiring of the classes within the component. For example, if a use case has complex validation rules, the component test should only verify that invalid input leads to the correct error response (e.g., a 400 Bad Request). The specific validation rules and their corresponding error messages should be exhaustively tested in that use case's own sociable unit tests. This prevents brittle tests and respects the test pyramid.

## What These Tests Are NOT

- **Not Unit Tests:** They are not focused on a single class but on the collaboration between several classes (route, controller, use case).
- **Not Integration Tests:** They do not talk to a real database or other live external services. They explicitly use test doubles at the boundaries.

## Naming Conventions

- **Standard:** Component test files MUST follow the naming convention `<component-name>.component.test.ts`. For application-level tests that span multiple components or test the application's overall wiring, `app.component.test.ts` is appropriate.

## Example Implementation

- `src/__tests__/component/register.component.test.ts`

## Enforcement

Violation of these standards will result in build failures during CI and/or rejection during code review. These standards are non-negotiable to ensure the quality and maintainability of our component tests.
